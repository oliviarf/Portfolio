        <h2>
            To round out my time in UBC’s computer science program,
            I participated in a project course that found me working with seven of my peers to create an
            employee portal for the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia which we called Desk Buddy.
            After missing out on an internship in the summer of 2020 due to the pandemic, this course was an ideal way for me to
            gain experience in developing a product alongside a small team of developers. <br>
            <br>
            As per ICBC’s request, the app itself consisted of 3 modules:
            a desk booking system to maintain COVID-19 safety measures in offices,
            a community board for employees to connect with one another,
            and a mail management system to track and get assistance with mail when working from home.<br>
            <br>
            Luckily, every member of my team was flexible, involved, and committed to the deadlines we placed upon ourselves.
            I began the semester with the intention of working solely on the front end, but found myself helping out with the back end
            and database management where needed. Creating this app taught me how much thought is required for user-facing features.
            Our team spent long hours on Zoom debating if our community board should allow collapsible posts, what the ideal font size is,
            and so on, but it was a necessary part of the process as I came to learn. <br>
            <br>
            From a technical standpoint, the Desk Buddy app gave me my first chance to work with React,
            something I had been seeking out for a number of months. Additionally, I became comfortable with working in an
            environment employing Agile practices. <br>
            <br>
            Ultimately, we were able to achieve a solution that pleased ICBC and earned us a final grade of 87%.<br>
            <br>
            Created with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, SQL, and TypeScript.
