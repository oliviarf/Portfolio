            Best Beginner Hack <br>
            <br>
            SAP iXp Hack4Good, hosted in October of 2020, was only my second hackathon since beginning to study software development.
            Fortunately, I was able to find a team of 4 that worked together across time zones to create a prize winning project.
            The Mindful Shopper is a Google Chrome extension that encourages sustainability in the era of online shopping
            by providing users with suggestions for items from second-hand and vintage retailers.
            Users can search for pieces through the extension directly,
            or view recommendations based on their current page while shopping on fast fashion sites such as H&M.
            Click <a href="https://devpost.com/software/the-mindful-shopper" style="font-size: 20px">here</a> for The Mindful Shopperâ€™s full writeup on Devpost. <br>
