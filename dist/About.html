                Hi, I’m Olivia. <br>
                I first started coding in 2017.
            </h1>
            <p>
                Since then I have studied abroad, worked in a variety of languages,
                connected with developers from across the world,
                and found that my passion lies in front end and mobile development. <br>
                <br>
                When I’m not coding I love to study languages that aren’t computer based, bake cookies, and watch anime.<br>
                <br>
                Here, you will find five projects that I have been a part of over the years.
                Each is unique yet essential to my growth and identity as a developer. <br>
                <br>
                Having graduated from the University of British Columbia in June,
                I am eagerly searching for a full time position in Singapore or Vancouver that will allow this portfolio to grow for years to come.
