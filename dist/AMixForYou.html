            A Mix For You
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Every special occasion calls for a playlist and, among my friends, this job usually fell to me.
            Not that I minded, music is and has always been my favourite way to express myself.
            Combining this passion with my newfound love for software development lead to the creation of A Mix For You.<br>
            <br>
            Using Spotify’s API, A Mix For You generates a custom and classic eight track playlist for users.
            The overall genre and mood of the playlist is determined through responses to a series of questions such as
            ‘How’s the weather today?’ (Sunny is upbeat; rainy is downtempo.) and ‘Which album that best suits your taste?’
            (Blonde will earn you more R&B; Odd will lead to quintessential K-pop.)<br>
            <br>
            Initially, A Mix For You was an iOS application, giving me my first taste of native mobile app development.
            With this rendition, I went as far as submitting the app to Apple for review. When it was rejected,
            I decided to go back to the drawing board.<br>
            <br>
            Inspired by the cross-platform application I was building for an internship at the time,
            I decided to take a similar path with A Mix For You. I rebuilt the app in JavaScript,
            and continue to fine tune the user experience in hopes of resubmitting it to both the App Store and Google Play Store.<br>
            <br>
            Currently, I am focused on gaining more experience with React by using the JavaScript code base of A Mix For You as a web app.<br>
            <br>
            Over the years, A Mix For You has been a way for me to experiment with a variety of technologies, languages,
            and libraries in my spare time. It has taught me a number of valuable lessons and I can’t wait to see where it takes me next.<br>
