            EV App
        </h1>
        <h2>
            This cross-platform mobile application was developed in 2019 during my internship with the clean energy research centre Merida Labs.
            From initial mockups to a functional product, I was the only developer working on the application.
            It remains one of the largest projects I have been involved with and an informative experience with full stack development.<br>
            <br>
            At its core, the application connects users to their local electric vehicle charging infrastructure,
            providing locations and information on local charging stations through a map interface.<br>
            <br>
            This information was obtained from the Open Charge Map API, and is filterable on attributes such as charger type and cost.
            The app was also connected to a MySQL database to support the logging of information
            including the most high traffic times for a given charging station. <br>
            <br>
            Created with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.
