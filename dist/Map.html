            Electrolyzer Map
        </h1>
        <h2>
            This application was also developed during my time at Merida Labs.
            It displays the projected costs for Hydrogen Electrolysis across various Canadian provinces using data compiled by Tung Nguyen,
            one of the lab’s graduate researchers.<br>
            <br>
            Creating this app was the first time I had to design a UI without intuitively knowing what a potential user would be looking for.
            Prior to sitting in on Tung’s presentation, I had truthfully never heard the word electrolysis before.
            With the feedback of the lab, I was ultimately able to create an interactive map with a variety of filters to provide cost projections. <br>
            <br>
            Created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
